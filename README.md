# CS50P

This repo contains my solutions to the problem sets given for Harvard's CS50P in Java and Python.

CS50P is a prep course for CS50 that is specifically designed to teach the fundamentals of Python; however, since the university I am transferring to in the fall of 23, SFSU, requires proficiency in Java, I will do the problem sets in that language as well.
